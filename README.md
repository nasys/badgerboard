### Prerequisites

##### Downloads


* [**Arduino**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

#### General installation
* [Download](https://github.com/nasys/badgerboard/archive/master.zip) this library as **.zip** file

now this file is in downloads folder named Badgerboard-master.zip

* Open Arduino and include it under **Sketch -> Include library -> add .zip library**
* Open **Files -> Examples -> badger -> LoRa_temp_hum**

##### Mac OS X installation with Git

* Open "**Finder**" (Press &#8984;+ Space ) 
* type in "terminal" and open it
* type "cd Documents/Arduino/libraries"
* type "git clone https://github.com/nasys/badgerboard"
* Now when you open up your Arduino and _Badgerboard_ library should appear under **Sketch -> Include library**

##### Windows installation with Git

Coming soon

### **Badgerboard setup**
#### Test out your Badgerboard
```diff
- DO NOT POWER ON WITHOUT ANTENNA! 

```

* Make sure Badgerboard power switch is turned ON (button towards USB port)
* connect Badgerboard to your PC/Mac 
* Open Arduino
* Open Blink example **Files -> Examples -> Basic -> Blink**
* Make sure you have chosen correct board  **Tools -> Board -> LilyPad Arduino USB** and correct port **Tools -> Port** 
* Change the time(number in milliseconds) inside the brackets after "**delay**" to change the speed of blinking
* To **upload** click on the __right pointing arrow__ on the top-left corner of your Arduino window

In case all of this works then you have successfully uploaded your first program to Badgerboard


#### LoRa sensor setup

* Open **File -> Examples -> Badgerboard -> LoRa_temp_hum**
* Replace examples **devEUI**(16 hex char), **appEUI**(16 hex char) and **appKey**(32 hex char) with the ones that Your LoRaWANâ„¢ solution provider has assigned.([example 1](#example-1)) 
* Upload Your code to Badgerboard

To format the **devEUI**, **appEUI** and **appKey** you can use our [converter](http://badgerboard.io/tools/)

##### example 1

	
	In Arduino code your devEUI, appEUI and appKey are represented by char array and should look similar to 
	this example
	
	const uint8_t devEUI[8] = {
	0x11, 0x11, 0x22, 0x22,
	0x33, 0x33, 0x44, 0x44
	};

	const uint8_t appKey[16] = {
	0x11, 0x11, 0x11, 0x11,
	0x11, 0x11, 0x22, 0x22,
	0x22, 0x22, 0x22, 0x22,
	0x33, 0x33, 0x33, 0x33
	};

	const uint8_t appEUI[8] = {
	0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44,
	0x55, 0x66, 0x77, 0x88
	};

### Debugging

To see Debugging messages open Serial Monitor **Tools -> Serial Monitor**
#### Known issues

* Take a look under [troubleshooting](https://github.com/nasys/badgerboard/wiki/Troubleshooting) page
* Works only with Arduino version 1.6.10 and later
